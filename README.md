# Oil and Gas Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing oil and gas data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to understand the underlying patterns in the dataset.

## Project Structure
- `oil_gas.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis and visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the analysis.
- `images/`: Directory for storing images and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information about oil and gas production. The data includes various features such as production volume, well locations, and other relevant attributes.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into several key sections:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the dataset to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Visualizations**: Creating visual representations of the data to better understand the relationships between different variables.
4. **Modeling**: Applying machine learning models to predict future trends or classify data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
